# Introduction

## How to measure test suite awesomeness?

* Code coverage

* Fault detection rate

    - Mutation testing

* Is that enough?

### Short answer
No

## Why not?

* Code is more than technical performance

    - TODO Analogy

* DevOps relies heavily on quick iteration

    - Heavy reliance on CI/CD $\implies$ tests must keep up

    - Maintainability is crucial

# Performance measures

## Code coverage: inherently flawed

## Mutation testing: maybe good?

# Maintainability

## Why important?
